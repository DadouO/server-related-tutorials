### KO / Some php modules are missing

Edit: Example to enable php modules already is present on [doc > Extend this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/wordpress/).

LATER: Enable php modules if needed

### KO / REST API error

Seems ok when [accessing manually](https://test-wordpress.masamune.fr/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1).

LATER: This seems time-consuming, lots of stuff to check. Fix later.

## Docker recos

### KO / Change custom user
